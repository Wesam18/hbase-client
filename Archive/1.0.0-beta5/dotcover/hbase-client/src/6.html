		<code id="src6" class="dotCoverSource"><pre>Feature: HBase Stargate Client
	In order to read and write HBase data
	As an application developer
	I want access to all available REST operations on HBase Stargate via a managed client API

Background:
	Given I have everything I need to test a disconnected HBase client, with the following options:
		| server URL              | content type | false row key |
		| http://test-server:9999 | text/xml     | row           |
	And I have everything I need to test a content converter for XML
	And I have an HBase client

Scenario Outline: Create a table
	Given I have created a new table schema
	And I have set my table schema&#39;s name to &quot;&lt;table&gt;&quot;
	And I have added a column named &quot;&lt;column&gt;&quot; to my table schema
	When I create a table using my table schema
	Then the operation &lt;should or should not&gt; have succeeded
	And if the operation succeeded, a REST request for schema updates should have been submitted with the correct &lt;method&gt;, &lt;resource&gt;, &lt;table&gt;, and &lt;column&gt;
	And if there was an exception, it should have been the expected &lt;exception&gt; type
	And if there was an exception, it should have had the expected exception &lt;message&gt;
Examples:
	| table  | column | method | resource    | should or should not | exception         | message                                      |
	| {null} | {null} | PUT    |             | should not           | ArgumentException | ResourceBuilder_MinimumForSchemaUpdateNotMet |
	| {null} |        | PUT    |             | should not           | ArgumentException | ResourceBuilder_MinimumForSchemaUpdateNotMet |
	|        | {null} | PUT    |             | should not           | ArgumentException | ResourceBuilder_MinimumForSchemaUpdateNotMet |
	|        |        | PUT    |             | should not           | ArgumentException | ResourceBuilder_MinimumForSchemaUpdateNotMet |
	| test   |        | PUT    | test/schema | should not           | ArgumentException | ErrorProvider_ColumnNameMissing              |

Scenario Outline: Write a single value
	Given I have an identifier consisting of a &lt;table&gt;, a &lt;row&gt;, a &lt;column&gt;, a &lt;qualifier&gt;, and a &lt;timestamp&gt;
	When I write the value &quot;hello world&quot; using my identifier
	Then a REST request should have been submitted with the correct &lt;method&gt; and &lt;resource&gt;
	And the REST request should have contained 1 cell
	And one of the cells in the REST request should have had the value &quot;hello world&quot;
Examples:
	| table | row | column | qualifier | timestamp | method | resource         |
	| test  | 1   | alpha  |           |           | POST   | test/1/alpha     |
	| test  | 1   | alpha  | x         |           | POST   | test/1/alpha:x   |
	| test  | 1   | alpha  |           | 4         | POST   | test/1/alpha/4   |
	| test  | 1   | alpha  | x         | 4         | POST   | test/1/alpha:x/4 |

Scenario: Write multiple values
	Given I have created a set of cells for the &quot;test&quot; table
	And I have added cells to my set with the following properties:
		| row | column | qualifier | value       |
		| 1   | beta   | x         | hello world |
		| 1   | beta   | y         | dlrow olleh |
		| 1   | beta   | z         | lorum ipsum |
	When I write the set of cells
	Then a REST request should have been submitted with the following values:
		| method | resource |
		| POST   | test/row |
	And the REST request should have contained 3 cells
	And the cells in the REST request should have had the following values:
		| row | column | qualifier | value       |
		| 1   | beta   | x         | hello world |
		| 1   | beta   | y         | dlrow olleh |
		| 1   | beta   | z         | lorum ipsum |

Scenario Outline: Read a row
	Given I have a cell query consisting of a &lt;table&gt;, a &lt;row&gt;, a &lt;column&gt;, a &lt;qualifier&gt;, a &lt;begin&gt; timestamp, a &lt;end&gt; timestamp, and a &lt;max&gt; number of results
	When I read a row using my query
	Then a REST request should have been submitted with the correct &lt;method&gt; and &lt;resource&gt;
Examples:
	| table | row | column | qualifier | begin | end | max | method | resource               |
	| test  | 1   |        |           |       |     |     | GET    | test/1                 |

	Then a REST request should have been submitted with the following values:
		| method | resource    |
		| GET    | test/schema |
	And there should have been a WebException with a message equivalent to the resource called &quot;NoServerResponse&quot;</pre></code><script type="text/javascript">
